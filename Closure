A closure in Scala is a function whose value depends on variables declared outside of it. Let’s take an example.


scala> var c=5
c: Int = 5
scala> val mul2=(a:Int,b:Int)=>(a+b)*c
mul2: (Int, Int) => Int = $$Lambda$1533/239864031@6d90e705
scala> mul2(2,3)

res45: Int = 25


scala> c=7
c: Int = 7
scala> mul2(2,3)


In this example, mul2 reads the new value of ‘c’ when we call it a second time.
