A Scala Option is a kind of a container. It can hold zero or one element of a type. 
When it holds a value, it holds Some[T]; otherwise, it holds a None object, as we discussed in the previous question.


scala> val o:Option[Int]=Some(7)
o: Option[Int] = Some(7)
scala> val o1:Option[Int]=None
o1: Option[Int] = None
